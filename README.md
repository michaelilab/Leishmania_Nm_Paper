Leishmania cause cutaneous and visceral diseases affecting millions worldwide. The parasite cycle between insect and mammalian hosts.  In this study, we determined the landscape of 2â€™-O- methylation (Nm) modification on  the rRNA and found that two positions change during cycling between its two life stages. Overexpression of LM32Cs1C1 snoRNA guiding one of these positions compromised growth affecting  translation.

RiboMeth-Seq libraries were analyzed to detect Nm modifications in various Leishmania species and across different lifes stages- promastigotes and amastigotes.
